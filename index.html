                    Hello! My name is Austin Costa and I enjoy solving problems with code.
                    My interest and passion for programming grew out of a curiosity about programming 
                    when I first began with C# and tinkering with the Unity game engine â€” I ended up learning 
                    a lot about object-oriented priciples and quickly became infatuated with C# as a language, 
                    and subsequently I start toying with other languages and frameworks as well. This passion 
                    technology and problem-solving led me toward pursuing a formal education in Software Development. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast-forward to today and I've completed my Associate of Applied Science in Software Development.
                    I gained a valuable foundation in the best practices surrounding software design and development 
                    and I even had the privledge of interning for <a href="https://www.cinfin.com/" target="_blank">
                    The Cincinnati Insurance Companies</a> where I was a Software Development intern for the Management 
                    Liability department's SCRUM team. As an Intern I did a lot of backend programming in C#, creating, updating and 
                    parsing XML schema as well as writing SQL scripts.
